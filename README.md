# MTBA6MicroinfPinguins
Project for the course Microinformatique with the robot ePuck2.

# Instructions for using this repo
The lib.zip needs to be extracted at the root, but it will not be watched (excluded in gitignore) by git as it has lots of files that need never change, so it might cause havoc if there was an issue with it.

# Tips to remember
## Mac show/hide hidden files
On Mac, in order to show hidden files (files that start with a . are hidden by default on mac, so .gitignore for example) :
Open up your folder
Press Command+Shift+Dot
Your hidden files will become visible. Repeat step 2 to hide them again!
