 * Introduction: Main file of this project. This is a penguin simulator,
 * 					where we will use the microphones to identify monofrequency
 * 					sources of sound, and find their direction. The user will
 * 					then be prompted using a serial bluetooth connection for
 * 					which source to go to (as if each source were a chick of
 * 					the penguin robot). Then, the robot will navigate towards
 * 					this source/chick... Unless dangerous killer whales are heard !
